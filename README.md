Remember that computer lab where the ceiling tiles were stained yellow and nobody asked why, where Marcus became a folk hero by changing EVERY SINGLE desktop wallpaper to that dancing baby gif from 1999 including the teacher's laptop which was projecting to the entire class, and Mrs. Henderson just stood there watching this baby groove across her lesson plan about Microsoft Excel while 30 teenagers lost their absolute minds? The legend of "Keyboard Key Thief Kevin" who spent an entire semester stealing random keys from different keyboards so by June every computer was missing like Q, 7, and the left Shift - the janitor found a Ziploc bag with 47 keys in Kevin's locker and Kevin deadpan said "I'm making art" - they never proved anything and Kevin walked free like Keyser Söze. That beautiful autumn day when someone (definitely Brian) discovered the "Net Send" command and spent 4th period sending "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID" to random computers across the school network causing THREE separate kids to have mental breakdowns before the IT guy finally shut down the server screaming "WHO IS DOING THIS" into the void. Remember Jenny who brought in a wireless mouse, secretly plugged the receiver into the teacher's computer, and spent the ENTIRE class period subtly moving his cursor during attendance until Mr. Phillips stood up and literally SCREAMED at his computer "WHY ARE YOU BETRAYING ME" - this man questioned his entire reality for 45 minutes while we died silently trying not to laugh. The day the substitute teacher asked "does anyone know how to connect to the projector" and you volunteered, spent 15 minutes "troubleshooting" which was actually you installing Miniclip bookmarks, changing the homepage to Zombo.com, and setting the volume to max so the next person who opened Internet Explorer got hit with "WELCOME TO ZOMBO.COM" at full blast - you sat back down a hero, the substitute none the wiser. This $10 WiFi stick has a live terminal where you type commands in your browser like you're in The Matrix, comes loaded with 17 pranks including ones that make computers talk and open 50 calculator windows, and 2005-you would've literally faked sick for a week just to figure out how to build it. **Just flash the code, plug it in, connect to the WiFi it creates, open 192.168.4.1 in your browser, and you've got a retro green hacker terminal that executes whatever chaos your heart desires - this is for everyone who got yelled at for "touching things you shouldn't" when really you were just trying to see if you COULD make the printer in the principal's office print Shrek memes (you could).** 🚀
